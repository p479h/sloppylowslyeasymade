Hello, these are just some personal projects I am working on. 
Simulation leads to a physics simulator. 
Chemicks leads to my first project. It is very poorly written but I decided to leave it here anyways. Maybe someone wants to use this for whatever reason.


I have decided to make these PUBLIC! So you may use them as you wish, but please, don't claim ownership or try to sell anything here.
No need to acknowledge me either. Just use this wherever you want. Have fun! 
:)
