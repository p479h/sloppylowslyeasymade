Hey!!! If you are here for the simulator project I have just uploaded all the files. They are not organized but to play with the simulator you can simply run the script Page1_2.py.
Tomorrow I will write docstrings on all of the scripts to make sure that they all are well documented :)

I have decided to amke these PUBLIC! So you may use them as you wish, but please, don't claim ownership or try to sell anything here.
No need to acknowledge me either. Just use this wherever you want. Have fun! 
:)
