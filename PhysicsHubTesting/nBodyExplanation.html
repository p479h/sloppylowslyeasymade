  <p class="sim_explanation">This is an N-body simulation where all bodies occupy
  part of the 2dimensional space available in the simulation. To make numerical inputs
  less intimidating, some values were scaled up and down. This simulation is still under
  development. But it is meant to give you a visual intuition as to how forces add
  in a setting where gravitation dominates. In this relative scale, the distance between
  gridlines is 50m. This text is not final, it is only meant as a test!</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">The law of gravitation was delveloped by newton a couple hundred years ago.
    It describes attraction between masses in terms of the masses and
    their absolute distance.</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">But before showing you the math, it is better to visualize the phenomenon.
    Below you can find an image of masses whose attraction the law of gravitation
    attempts to describe</p>

  <p class="sim_explanation">These forces are always directed torwards the centers of mass of the masses. This is because of the symetry of the sphere. For every atom above the middle point of each mass, there is one below pulling in the exact opposite direction. Therefore what is left for the net force is the pulling directly torwards the center of mass.</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">Another property of gravity is that the force that one the masses involved feel is the same (of course only valid for the simple geometry of two sphere and some other specific scenarios.) But lets focus on the simple case with two masses. In this case it has been shown that doubling either mass causes the gravitational pull to double. Doubling both masses causes the attraction to become four times greater!!! Therefore it makes sense that a formula that describes the gravitational pull as a function of the masses and distance would contain a term that results from multiplying to the masses involved!
    Something in the form:
   $$m1m2k$$
  </p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">Furthermore, doubling the distance between the bodies causes the pull to become a fourth of what it was before, therefore it makes sense that part of this relationship comes in the form: $${1\over r^2}km1m2$$</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">Lastly, measurements show that the absolute value of the force is obtained when we take \(k\) to be \(6.674*10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}\). This value is usually written in textbooks using capital G. Maybe it was meant to represent "gravity" but I honestly don't know.$$|F| = Gm1m2\over r^2$$</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">So, now you have a formula to compute the strength of gravitational attraction, given that you have the absolute distance between the objects. But what happens when all you are give is a set of points and the objects' masses?</p>
  <p class="sim_explanation">The "best" way to approach this is to first set up and understand the frame of reference which defines the positions of the objects. In other words, to better understand the coordinate system that describes the positions and velocities of the objects relative to an origin, which could be another object. Follows an example of what it would "look like" for masses to be in a coordinate system. (mouse over to visualize)</p>

      <p class="sim_explanation">In this case, all we mean when we say the objects are in a coordinate system is that they have known positions. The gridlines for instance could represent some known space in between them.</p>
      <p class="sim_explanation">Now, if we want to calculate the force of gravity between two objects, we need to know their absolute distance. One of the properties of the most common coordinate system (cartesian, which is most likely what you are using) is that the distance between the objects within this coordinate system does not necessarely depend on the origin, but on the relationship between the coordinates of the objects. Just something I want to throw out there is that many students get confused when they see crazy things like inverted or rotated coordinate systems. But before moving on I just want to enphasize that changing the orientation of a cartesian coordinate system will not change the distance between the two objects or the direction of pull relative to one another.

        Furthermore whenever a gravitational pull is calculated for two objects, the net pull on each object should point torwards the other. And the force each planet experiences is the same!!! Their accelerations may depend on their masses, but they experience a net force with equal magnetude.
        This means that if you have two planets, A and B, all you the force exerted on A is in the direction of A to B, and vice versa for the force of A on B. This terminology should remind you of vectors, which are the key to numerically describing direction and magnetude (which we need to get the net gravitational pull). Which is what we will do now.

        Lets start digging into the math with another visualization encompassing everything you have read so far and setting up the problem in a mathematical way. We are given two masses \(A\) and \(B\) of masses  and positions \((Ax, Ay)\) and \(A_m\), and \((Bx, By)\) and \(B_m\) respectively.
        This is what the problem would look like:

      $$|F|=\frac{GA_m B_m}{\sqrt{(Bx-Ax)^2+(By-Ay)^2}}$$</p>
      <p class="sim_explanation">
        Now finally the direction, which involves some trigonometry. The idea here is that we are about to represent the net forces on each planet as vectors that when added give the resultant net force.
        This can be done because when it comes to forces, it is impossible to tell the number of forces that add up to the net force from the perspective of the center of mass. Thing about this with the
        following thought experiment: You are playing tag of war blindfolded. Would you be able to tell how many people are pulling against you? Probably not. The same can be said to any force. They
        can be represented as sums of other other forces. Luckily for us. Forces add just like sidelengths on a triangle, which essencially means that if you represent your net force as a sum of two
        perpendicular forces (because then you will have a right angled triangle) you can safely find out which part of the force goes in a direction of your choice. Of course, that includes the directions along
        the x and y axis.</p>
      <p class="sim_explanation">
        So, all you need to do is to separate the net force on each object into two perpendicular forces(components). One parallel to the x direction and another parallel to the y direction. Which again, requires pythagoras or
        basic geometry. In which case the lengths of the components will represent the direction along each axis and the sign the specific direction (specifics depending on the coordinate system you are working with).
        In any case, below you can find an image that may help visualize this.

        With that out of the way things are about to get interesting. When finding out the components, people usually try to get an angle inside the triangle, compute its sine and cosine and then multiply it by the net gravitational pull to get each component.
        Which is not wrong by any means, but it can get complicated because in doing so, one may have to make a decision about which sign to give each component, which can only be done by checking how the coordnates relate. In doing so, signs can get switched.
        Therefore, I personally prefer to skip the step where a the angle is obtained and skip directly to the step where the sine and cosine are obtained. If done properly, you also get the correct signs every time. The idea is simple:
        the sine of an angle is defined as being the length of the opposite side(relative to the angle) of the triangle devided by the length of the hypothenuse. So the sine of the angle that lies at the point where object A is is simply the
        difference in it's y-coordinate and the y-coordinate of B. Furthermore, the same argument can be applied to the x-coordinates to obtain the cosine of this angle. $$sin(a)=\frac{(By-Ay)}{\sqrt{(Bx-Ax)^2+(By-Ay)^2}}$$ $$cos(a)=\frac{(Bx-Ax)}{\sqrt{(Bx-Ax)^2+(By-Ay)^2}}$$
      </p>

        Now, remember one thing, the force of gravity we calculated using newton's equation was calculated using absolute values, therefore it has a positive result. Which in this case just means it has not been attributed direction. So if mass B is above and to
        the right of A (we are working on the coordinate system of the picutes you have seen so far, where positive x and y are torwards right and top respectively), the sine and cosine we calculated above will come out with positive signs for this angle a!!!
        Which when multiplied by the net gravitational pull, will still be positive, which is correct for this coordinate system. Furthermore, we could end here since we know that the components that pull A and B are the same but with inverse direction. But I want to show you something first.</p>
        <p class="sim_explanation">
        One could try and use this same argument for mass B, calculating the sine as \(sin(b)=(By-Ay)/r\) with b being the angle that lies at object B. But there is an issue. The result will also come out positive!
        The reason is that order of subtraction matters!!! Therefore in the case of angle b, \(sin(b)=(Ay-By)/r\)!!! Which in this case, will indeed output the correct sign. So, how do you know which coordinate subtract from which? The best way is to test it out
        when working out a solution. But you could also keep in mind that the point where your mass is located will be subtracted from the other point. This is valied for both sine, cosine, and for both axis. Therefore, a generalization for forces on A and B is:
        $$F_Ax=|F|\frac{x_b-x_a}{\sqrt{(x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2}}$$
        $$F_Ay=|F|\frac{y_b-y_a}{\sqrt{(x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2}}$$
        $$F_Bx=|F|\frac{x_a-x_b}{\sqrt{(x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2}}$$
        $$F_By=|F|\frac{y_a-y_b}{\sqrt{(x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2}}$$
      </p>
      <p class="sim_explanation">
        Note how the equations are similar, very little changes and there are easily detectable patterns. Therefore, this can be represented in vector notation.
        $$\vec{F_{A}}=|F|\frac{\vec{B}-\vec{A}}{\sqrt{(x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2}}$$
        Where the \(\vec{B}\) and \(\vec{A}\) are the coordinates of B and A respectively.
